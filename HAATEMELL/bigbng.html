            <td>Being a simple model, there is a requirement of less resources.</td>

            <td>As it is easy to implement, it is the prime choice for the majority of students. Mostly, it is because of its as easy implementation as an SDLC model.</td>
            <td>This model is not at all suitable for object-oriented projects and otherwise complex projects. It is because such projects require fairly sought-after techniques and experienced staff members.</td>
