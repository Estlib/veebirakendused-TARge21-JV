    <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>

    <table border="2">

            <td>PROS</td>
            <td>CONS</td>
        </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Fast. Instead of a couple of years, like in other software development methods, extreme programming projects last only several months. There is a fast-paced work environment with no wasting of time. There is continuous integration and deployment.</td>
    <td>Code overcomes design. The focus of XP is definitely the code rather than the design. The design is what sells the application, so the customer could be unhappy with the end product if the design is not good enough. Sometimes this can result in failing to implement the software requirements fully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Visible. Open communication within the team helps everyone keep up with the project progress. Everyone works on individual tasks, yet the regular meetings record the improvement collectively. Due to the visibility of XP projects, failures and bugs are limited.</td>
    <td>Location. XP projects are difficult to implement when the customer is away from the developmental team. Typically the XP interactions are successful when the team members meet face to face. Therefore applying extreme programming limits the range of projects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Reduces costs. In extreme programming, the feedback loop is reduced. Thus, the cost of change is also reduced. In other methodologies, the code is remanufactured only after customer feedback. Here, changes are implemented throughout the developmental period.</td>
    <td>Lack of documentation. The constant changes cannot be documented properly. Thus, there are high risks of unexpected failures that cannot be tracked. Even when bugs are fixed, without accurate documentation itâ€™s possible that the same errors can recur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Teamwork. In XP the developers work hard to accomplish goals within tight deadlines. They support each other throughout the entire project. They design and test the code together. Pair programming gathers them in groups of two where they share ideas and create software side by side. Hence, there is increased employee commitment and satisfaction.</td>
    <td>Stress. There is a lot of pressure working with tight deadlines. If the developers have high stress levels completing tasks on time, they are more likely to make mistakes while coding. Subsequently, software quality could be reduced due to the scheduling.</td>
